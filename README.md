####How does this work?
GitHub has a awesome feature where you can publish a static HTML/CSS/JS site for free by just commiting to a repo. This is how our site is setup. When you commit to the `gh-pages` branch, GitHub automatically deploys the change to our website!

####A message to the business department
The use of the web editor is now prohibited. Using the web editor to make changes can lead to the live website breaking and the commit messages are very undescriptive. Please test locally and only push when everything works.
